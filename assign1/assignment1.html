<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>There are four parts to this assignment. Each is independent of the
other.
They are increasingly more difficult. You should try them in the order
listed
below. Parts (a) and (b) will be done in Java. Part (c) and (d) will be done in C.</p><p>(<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Important note</span>:
 "System.out.println" in Java is renamed to "System.println" in ROSE, 
actually in SimpleRTJ. ROSE doesn't implement the standard Java library;
 SimpleRTJ provides it.)</p><p>To do this assignment, you must study <a href="http://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/%7Emcheng/360/summer.2013/rose.summary.html" target="_blank">the design of ROSE</a>.
 Make sure that you understand the scheduling levels as specified in our
 "uvic.posix.Thread" class under "lib-source/" directory.<br></p>
<h3>a) Concurrent sharing of a single resource [10%]</h3>
<p>Consider the problem of three concurrent processes (threads)
incrementing
a global shared integer variable. Each process increments the shared
variable
by 1, 2, and 3 respectively for 10,000 times. Initially, the shared
variable
has a value of 0. Its value is printed after all three processes have
completed. We should expect the final result to be 60,000. <em>Surprise!</em></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question</span>: Sometimes, the results are not 60,000. Why?</p>
<p>In the code, go to folder <strong>a</strong> and work in <em>Race.java</em>.
For this part, the main() program is created as a SYSTEM level thread
in ROSE by default, which has the highest priority. It will create
three
instances of a <em>Race</em> thread, each of which is asked to
increment this global
shared integer variable. We'll create each <em>Race</em> thread at the
REAL_TIME
level. REAL_TIME level threads are scheduled in a round-robin fashion
with
a quantum size of 1 tick. A tick is specified at the command line to
ROSE.
For example, </p>
<pre><code>../soln/rose.exe 3 Race.bin<br></code></pre>
<p>specifies each tick to be 3 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Try setting the main thread's level to DAEMON before starting each
thread:</p>
<pre><code>    // create race threads here<br>    ...<br>    set( DAEMON ); // now, let the race threads run<br><br>    // Run race threads at REAL_TIME level<br></code></pre>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question</span>: The result turns out as 60,000. Why?</p>
<h3>b) Concurrent sharing of multiple resources [10%]</h3>
<p>On a symmetric mulitprocessor system, several CPUs share a common
memory.
Many concurrent processes may issue access to multiple shared resources
simultaneously. To prevent simultaneous access to a shared resource, we
often use a "spinlock" to control concurrent access. That is, a "lock"
is
associated with each shared resource, which is unlocked/free initially.
Before a process is allowed to make access to this shared resource, it
must lock it first by busy-waiting,</p>
<pre><code>while (locked) do nothing; // wait until lock is free<br>locked = true;             // now, lock it<br></code></pre>
<p>Let lock l1 be assocated with shared resource r1, and lock l2 be
associated
with shared resource r2. When a process wants to use r1 and r2, it must
lock l1 and l2 first. When it is done, it must unlock l1 and l2.</p>
<p>When there are mulitple applications/processes which may share the
same set
of shared resources, they must lock all of them in some application
dependent order.</p>
<p>For example, let us assume that we have two globally shared integers
s1 and s2.
There are two "race" threads (similar to Part a) increment s1 and s2 by
1, and
by 2 respectively 10,000 times. There are two "spinlocks" l1 and l2
assocated with s1 and s2.</p>
<p>If they both lock l1 and l2 in the same order, then the final
accumulated
results in s1 and s2 should be always 30,000 each.</p>
<p>What if one of the race threads, for some reason unknown to the
other, decided
to lock s2 first and then s1? <em>Surprise!</em></p>
<p>For this part, start editing the <em>LockRace</em> thread class in
folder <strong>b</strong>. You should
not need to modify <em>SpinLock</em>. Your main program will create
two instances of <em>LockRace</em>, two Spinlocks and two
shared integers. When you run this program, the final answer should
always
be 30,000.</p>
<p>Now, create a subclass <em>LockRace1</em> of <em>LockRace</em>.
Redefine the run() method
in class <em>LockRace1</em> so that it locks "l2" before "l1". In your
new main
program, now create an instance of <em>LockRace</em> and <em>LockRace1</em>.
Try running this program
several times (5 or 6 times). <br></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question</span>: What do you discover? <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Could you explain why?<br></p>
<h3>c) Pre-emptive and time-slice scheduling [30%]</h3>
<p>We want our ROSE Java VM to support four scheduling levels (ordered
by priority): </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>SYSTEM</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quantum: Infinite (or maximum possible number)</li>
      <li>Strategy: FCFS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>REAL_TIME</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quantum: 1</li>
      <li>Strategy: Round-Robin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>USER</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quantum: 2</li>
      <li>Strategy: Round-Robin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DAEMON</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quantum: Infinite (or maximum possible number)</li>
      <li>Strategy: FCFS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>In the last part of this assignment, you are asked to implement this
scheduling policy in our JVM. It is pre-emptive. That is, whenever a
higher
priority thread becomes ready (or runnable), it will pre-empt the
current
lower priority active thread immediately. There is no automatic
promotion or demotion. But, a thread may request to change its running
level during
its life time by called "set()".</p>
<p>For this part, you need to study the ROSE JVM source code, which is
written
in C. The only part that you are concerned about is the "j_thread.c",
which
is the runtime multithreading support of this JVM. For the most part,
you don't need to know. The only part that you need to study is the
scheduler.</p>
<p>Our thread scheduler is defined by the following API:</p>
<pre><code>    InitROSE(); // initialize various internal data structures<br>    Dispatch(); // select a new "active" thread to run<br>    AddReady(); // insert a thread into the ready_q<br>    PreemptIfNecessary(); // check for preemption condition<br>    Reschedule(); // "active" gives up its share of CPU; select another<br>                  // thread to run<br>    AssignQuantum(); // assign a fresh quantum<br>    VMTick();  // this is called by JVM whenever there is a "tick"<br></code></pre>
<p>and two very important variables:</p>
<pre><code>    threat_t  *ready_q;  // a queue of READY threads<br>    thread_t  *thr_active;  // a ptr to the current active thread<br></code></pre>
<p>Your task is to modify these procedures to implement our scheduling
policy. This aspect of
the assignment is the most difficult and will likely take you the most
amount of time.
Dispatch() and AddReady() are partially done, but
you may need to make some changes. InitROSE() is done for you; so you
don't
need to make any changes.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you must decide how you are going to represent
your
ready_q. That is, what data structure you are going to use? Then, you
must understand what these API operations do as far as the process/
thread state transition diagram is concerned.</p>
<p>The structure "thread_t" is defined in "jvm.h" by:</p>
<p>typedef struct thread_T thread_t;</p>
<pre><code>    struct thread_T {<br>        uint16    state;   // current state of this thread, which may be<br>                               // DEAD, READY and RUNNING (defined in jvm.h)<br>        int32     ticks;   // remaining number of ticks in this quauntum<br>        int32     pri;     // priority level of this thread<br>        struct thread_t  *next;<br>    }<br></code></pre>
<p>The priority level are defined in "jvm_cfg.h", which are from 0 to 3.</p>
<h3>d) Thread CPU time and Java native extension [20%]</h3>
<p>In this part of the assignment we are going to add functionality
from ROSE to our Java threads using <em>native</em> extension. This
will require coding in both Java and C. Your test solution will be in
folder <strong>/d</strong>, but most of the work will involve
modifying <strong>/rose</strong> and <strong>lib-source/uvic/posix/Thread.java</strong>.</p>
<p>This part will involve you modifying multiple files concurrently.
But it might be helpful to examine things in this order.</p>
<p>First, edit <em>lib-source/uvic/posix/Thread.java</em> and add a
new native function:</p>
<pre><code>    public static native int cpu_time();<br></code></pre>
<p>This function will return the current time, in milliseconds, that
the thread has been running and will directly run C code you are going
to write in ROSE. You will need to remake the uvic.jar:</p>
<pre><code>    cd ~/assign1/code/lib-source<br>    make clean; make<br></code></pre>
<p>Next, look through:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>timer.c</em> [GetVMTime()]: You can call this function to get
the current time (ms).</li>
  <li><em>j_thread.c</em>: This is where you will implement the actual
native function (i.e. create a function and modify a few functions).</li>
  <li><em>j_common.h</em>: Add forward declaration for function.</li>
  <li><em>j_lang.c</em>: This is where your function stub will go. Look
at how the other stubs are implemented to get an idea of how it is
done. <strong>Be aware of ordering</strong>.</li>
  <li><em>lib/ClassLinker.control</em>: Define your native stub <strong>in
the order it was specified in j_lang.c</strong>. This is very
important. Use the other functions defined there as a reference.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the new function definition has been added, we need to update
the ClassLinker: </p>
<pre><code>    cd ~/assign1/code/lib<br>    make<br></code></pre>
<p>This will re-package the ClassLinker and allow us to properly access
the native C function when we run <em>rose.exe</em>.</p>
<p>In folder <strong>d</strong>, there is a <em>TestTimer.java</em>
husk file that you can use for testing your native implemented file.
Feel free to add more tests.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>A directory called "soln" contains a compiled solution of rose.exe
that you will need to use for Question <strong>a)</strong> and <strong>b)</strong>.
When you have completed Question <strong>c)</strong>, use your version
to test <strong>a)</strong> and <strong>b)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Race.bin</strong> is a compiled solution to Part (a);</li>
  <li><strong>LockRace.bin</strong> is a solution to Part (b);</li>
  <li><strong>TestTimer.bin</strong> is a solution to Part (d); and</li>
  <li><strong>rose.exe</strong> is a solution to Part (c,d) and used
for testing parts (a) and (b).</li>
</ul>
<p>Run them and see what they do to get an understanding of what your
solutions can look like.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>The assignment is to be done in teams of two. Each member will
receive the same mark. If you do not have a partner or are having
issues with a partner: email me. Each team
member needs to understand all aspects of the assignment -- midterms
will be based around
understanding aspects of the assignments. It is <strong>HIGHLY</strong>
recommended that team
members do the assignment together.</p>
<p>Your evaluation will be based mostly on the correctness of your
solutions.
Testing is one way to evaluate correctness. Code inspection is another.
Even if your code runs, there may still be errors which can only be
uncovered by inspection. Obscured programming tricks and habits will
make programs harder to understand. Keep everything simple and elegant!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Coding and correctness [70%]</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The 4 parts of this assignment have different weights. Each
part is evaluated separately.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Documentation and testing [30%]
    <ul>
      <li>Doxygen and coding style (The solution should not be overly
convoluted.) [10%]</li>
