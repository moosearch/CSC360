<h1>Installing Cygwin for ROSE</h1>

<hr>
<h2>Cygwin</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cygwin is a UNIX-like execution
environment written for Windows
platform. It provides all the familiar UNIX utilities (e.g., ls, more,
cat, ..., and gcc). Note that all binaries generated by Cygwin GCC
compiler must be run inside Cygwin because it provides a Win32
compatible library linked with each executable (.exe) file. (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:
If you choose to do your ROSE development on Linux, then the entire GCC
toolchain is already available, you don't need to install Cygwin.
However, you may still need to install JDK, followed the instructions
below. At this moment, we still have some minor problem of running the
ClassLinker of SimpleRTJ.)<br>
</p>

<p>Download Cygwin (called "setup.exe") here:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cygwin.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Run setup.exe. Click Next. Install from
Internet. If you are on the
lab machines, set the install directory to your H drive and install for
"Just me" (i.e. H:\cygwin).</p>

<p>For download site,&nbsp; you could choose</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://cygwin.mirrors.hoobly.com/" target="_blank">http://cygwin.mirrors.hoobly.<wbr>com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>but it should not really matter which one you choose.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We will need some packages. Use the
search bar at the top to speed
things up, they should all be under the Devel heading. Where it says
skip, click it once and it should change to a version number with a
checked box under "Bin?". Now, here they are:</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>libncurses-devel</strong>: (devel) libraries for terminal
handling</li>
  <li><strong>gcc-core</strong>: C compiler</li>
  <li><strong>make</strong>: (The GNU version of the 'make' utility)</li>
  <li><strong>ctags</strong>: (A C programming language...)</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You may also install one of your
favoriate text editor (e.g., vim).
If you missed any package that you would like to install, just run
"setup.exe" again using the same initial directory that you install in
the beginning. It remembers all the settings and packages that you have
installed locally.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are on the lab machines, copy
the Cygwin Terminal shortcut on
the desktop and put in your H Drive. You will probably want to run
Cygwin from this shortcut, and who knows if it will be on the desktop
the next time you login.</p>

<h2>ROSE and Java<br>
</h2>

<p>Grab a copy of "<a href="http://webhome.csc.uvic.ca/%7Emcheng/360/summer.2013/labs/lab1/assign1.org.tgz" target="_blank">assign1.org.tgz</a>" (which includes ROSE) and put it
in your home folder (i.e.
C:\cygwin\home\&lt;username&gt; or H:\cygwin\home\&lt;username&gt;).<br>
</p>

<p>Start up cygwin (hopefully using the desktop shortcut). Then type:<br>
</p>

<pre><code>tar xzvf assign1.org.tgz   % this will unarchive everything<br>cd assign1<br>cd code<br>cd rose<br>make clean<br>make<br></code></pre>

<p>If everything works, then your GCC compiler is installed correctly,
otherwise check your bash shell $PATH variable.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If there are complaints about
permission denied: the folder could be
read only or cygwin might not have administrative privileges. In order
to run ROSE, you also need a copy of the Java compiler from Oracle
(formerly SUN).<br>
</p>

<p>You need to install the Java SDK (or JDK) from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html</a>.
You may choose 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) version. We are not running
the
standard JVM. We only use the "javac" compiler to generate the class
files (the byte code).<br>
</p>

<p>In order to run "javac",&nbsp; first check where JDK is installed.
Very likely it will be at:</p>

<pre>cd "/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_21/bin"<br></pre>

<p>Then, edit ".bashrc" (or ".bash_profile").
At the bottom of the file append:</p>

<pre><code>export PATH="/cygdrive/C/<wbr>Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_21/bin":$PATH<br></code></pre>

<div style="text-align: justify;">where "jdk1.7.0_21" is the version of
your java installed
location. Please note the <span style="font-weight: bold;">order</span>
of the new $PATH. Restart "cygwin" shell. Check whether "javac" is in
your PATH:</div>

<pre>which javac<br>/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_21/bin/javac<br></pre>

If you get an error message, then you have installed Java somewhere
else. Just update your Java bin $PATH accordingly.<br>

<h2>Running ROSE on Linux (Not Supported)<br>
</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Although ROSE had been tested on
Linux, we don't have the human resources to maintain and test both
Windows and Linux versions. If you must use Linux or OS X, then we
recommend that you install VirtualBox or any other VM emulator on
your machine and then run Windows XP or 7 inside a virtual machine. (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: <span style="color: red;">We haven't tested this particular installation</span>.
We don't guarantee that it will work, i.e., whether the Pentium
Performance Counter is supported in a virtual machine environment.)<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Login to MSDN using your Connex
account name and password, then you will able to download a free copy
of any Windows OS. Unfortunately, the secure download manager is a
Windows program. So, you need to download the software using Windows.<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">You will also be given a valid
registration key. After installing Windows, then just follow the
instructions above to install ROSE.<br>
