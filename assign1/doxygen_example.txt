# Doxygen #
 ---
 
## Overview ##

Doxygen is a piece of software that generates a HTML website documentation and API for your code base solely from your source code. 
(*This is very similar to javadoc for those who may have worked with that*). Doxygen allows people to review your code in HTML
and clusters together relevant pieces automatically. All that is required from the programmer's point-of-view is to include
minimal markup for doxygen in your source code to be used during its processing. When using the *markdown notation*, for example, the formatting of
documentation is very simple and leads to pleasant results. In addition, it is easy and natural to read in the actual source file.
To demonstrate, this site was actually made using markdown -- [see the source here.](doxygen.txt)

## Install ##

Download Doxygen from (A binary for Windows can be found if you scroll down):

 - [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html)
 
Install Doxygen using the default settings.

 ---

## Test ##

 - Run **doxywizard**. It should be in the start menu or can be found in *C:\\Program Files\\doxygen\bin\\doxywizard.exe*.
 - Specify the working directory as *C:/cygwin/home/<username\>/assign1* where <username\> is where you installed.
 - Change project name to *Assignment1*.
 - Set scan for source code directory to *C:/cygwin/home/<username\>/assign1/**code***.
 - Set destination directory to *C:/cygwin/home/<username\>/assign1*. Click *Next*.
 - Optimize for Java.
 - Uncheck the *Latex* box.
 - Click on the *Expert* tab. 
   - Goto *Topics -\> Project*. Check *JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF*. Uncheck *OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_JAVA*.
   - Goto *Topics -\> Source Browser*. Check *SOURCE_BROWSER*. Uncheck *STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS*. Uncheck *REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE*.
 - Click on the *Run* tab. Click *Run doxygen*.
 - When it has completed, click *Show HTML Output*.
 
If everything worked correctly, your web browser should open with a nice doxygen generated website. The generated documentation can be found at
*C:/cygwin/home/<username\>/assign1/html*.

## Basic Usage ##

 - For formatting, I recommend using [Markdown notation](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/markdown.html). It is very straightforward and readable.
 - Change **code/mainpage.md** to edit your index page.

To add comments to doxygen:

For Classes (take notice of the '/\*\*', not just '/\*':)

	/**
	 The first sentence will be used for the brief. Everything after this is more details. *Any text in between an asterisks like this will be in italics*. 
	 Having **Two asterisks will make it bold**. You can go crazy and do ***italics and bold with three asterisks***.
	 
	 Adding two new lines will create a new paragraph.
	*/
	public class Alice {
	
For Functions:

	/**
	 Brief description in one sentence. More details.
	 
	 And more details.
	 
	 @param level: The level the function will run at.
	 @param quantum: The process' quantum of time in milliseconds.
	 @return: Whether run was successful or not.
	*/
	public bool run(int level, float quantum) {

For Members:

	/**< More detailed description of variable above. Take notice of the extra '>'. */
	public int fail = 5; ///< Brief Description on the same line.
