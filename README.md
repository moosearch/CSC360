Operating Systems

Taken with Dr. Cheng in Summer 2013. We had to implement a few things related to operating system concepts in a small OS called the Realtime Java Operating System Emulator (ROSE). This included 
 -implementing thread scheduling, 
 -investigating the reader/writer problem,
 -looking at condition variables,
 -looking at disk scheduling algorithms,
 -implementing a filesystem, and
 -implementing a cache that would complement the file system
