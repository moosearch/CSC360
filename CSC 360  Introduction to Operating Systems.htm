    </td>
    <td class="course_desc_detail" width="80%">
      This course introduces the principles of an operating system, and 
its primary role as a resource manager of a computing system. The 
complexity of designing an operating system stems from the fact that it 
must coordinate many concurrent activities, e.g., facilitate  multi-user
 and multitasking, schedule processes and processors,  partition 
physical and virtual memory, control disk and file systems access, 
manage network communication and services, and interoperate with other 
computing systems and devices.
