Mark: 87/100

skeleton = what we were given
submitted = what we submitted

this assignment gave more freedom in designing a cache that would improve performance for reading and writing from a disk. a report was also written for it too, explaining how we went about the assignment.

unfortunately, i had my partner carry me through for most of this assignment, so i do not recall how it worked (we used a page table scheme to map our cache hits/misses).
